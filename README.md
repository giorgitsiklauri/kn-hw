### To run project, clone it and either:
1. Open and run from the IDE, or
2. `cd` into the project's root folder and run:
    1. `mvn package`
    2. `java -jar target\hw.jar`
    
Used OpenJDK17, but should be fine with any Java > 1.8 (you may need to change 17 to lower in the `pom.xml`'s properties XML element).

Contains some Unit and Integration tests.
